TOMBOY-COPY-AS

This is a Tomboy add-in that add a menu command for copying a Note to the clipboard in 
Trac Wiki format. 

When you have installed it, if the addins dir (~/.tomboy/addins) doesn't contain any 
files of name CopyAs-*.xsl it creates a number of translator files there. The files 
have names CopyAs-xxx.xsl where xxx is the format - initially Trac and PmWiki.
You can edit these files, and add new files with other xxx names. You can delete 
files - but if you delete all of them, the initial files will be copied there again.

To understand what the xsl script processes, look at the note files ~/.tomboy/*.note.


BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

This instruction is for Ubuntu 11.10, but is similar for other operating systems or versions.

Make sure you have installed the package mono-gmcs and gtk-sharp2 - you can do it with

  sudo apt-get install mono-gmcs gtk-sharp2

Check out the code from Google Code with

  svn checkout http://tomboy-copy-as.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tomboy-copy-as-read-only

Go into the resulting dir

  cd tomboy-copy-as-read-only

build it

  make

Install it into Tomboy

  make install

Restart Tomboy

  killall tomboy

and click the reload button if you have Tomboy in your gnome panel, to get it back in the panel.

Open a Tomboy note. The tools menu button now contains the Get as Track text menu item. 
Write some text in the note and use this menu. Now the clipboard contains the note text 
in track format.
